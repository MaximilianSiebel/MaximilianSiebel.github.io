**Title:** Multiplicative deconvolution under unknown error distribution

**Authors:** Sergio Brenner Miguel, Jan Johannes, Maximilian Siebel

**Abstract:** We consider a multiplicative deconvolution problem, in which the density $$f$$ or the survival function $$S^X$$ of a strictly positive random variable $$X$$ is estimated nonparametrically based on an i.i.d. sample from a noisy observation $$Y=Xâ‹…U$$ of $$X$$. The multiplicative measurement error $$U$$ is supposed to be independent of $$X$$. The objective of this work is to construct a fully data-driven estimation procedure when the error density $$f^U$$ is unknown. We assume that in addition to the i.i.d. sample from $$Y$$, we have at our disposal an additional i.i.d. sample drawn independently from the error distribution. The proposed estimation procedure combines the estimation of the Mellin transformation of the density $$f$$ and a regularisation of the inverse of the Mellin transform by a spectral cut-off. The derived risk bounds and oracle-type inequalities cover both - the estimation of the density $$f$$ as well as the survival function $$S^X$$. The main issue addressed in this work is the data-driven choice of the cut-off parameter using a model selection approach. We discuss conditions under which the fully data-driven estimator can attain the oracle-risk up to a constant without any previous knowledge of the error distribution. We compute convergences rates under classical smoothness assumptions. We illustrate the estimation strategy by a simulation study with different choices of distributions.
