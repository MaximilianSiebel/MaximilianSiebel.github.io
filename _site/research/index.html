<p>My interests include statistics of inverse problems, Bayesian statistics, and stochastic analysis. Currently, I am working on PDE-constrained regression models, where analytical theory of partial differential equations is combined with statistical regression models.</p>

    <p><em>In this thesis, we are considering a non-parametric and non-linear regression problem, where the corresponding regression function is supposed to be the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation depending on an unknown coefficient function. Based on noisy versions of this solution, we want to recover the unknown coefficient function by defining a Least Squares estimator motivated by the theory of ill-posed linear statistical inverse problems. Afterward, we study the statistical quality of this estimator by deriving concentration inequalities and minimax optimal bounds. This approach is part of a more general model, which will be studied first. For a better understanding, we are further illustrating the statistical behavior of the estimator by numerical experiments.</em></p>

    <p><em>In mathematical statistics, Bernstein-von Mises Theorems are regarded as the link between frequen- tistic statistics and the Bayesian approach, since under special conditions asymptotically equivalent results can be obtained. This thesis first introduces the different approaches of frequentistic statistics and of Bayesian statistics and motivates the consideration of Bernstein-von Mises Theorems in semi-parametric models. A generalised Bernstein-von-Mises Theorem is proved under the condition that the considered functional of interest satisfies certain regularity conditions. After specific adap- tions the generalised Theorem is applied to the White Noise Model and a corresponding Theorem is proved. Based on the theoretical foundations, the occurring effects of the Bernstein-von Mises Theorem are visualised in a slightly modified White Noise Model using a Monte-Carlo-Simulation and considering a linear functional of interest. The applicability of the Bernstein-von Mises Theorem is finally motivated in other statistical models, in particular in the Nonlinear Autoregressive Model and in the Density Model, respectively. Different mathematical principles used in this thesis are explained in detail at the beginning.</em></p>
